// WaitingToStart -> InProgress" with UDP 0.0.0.0:7777 open, and their
// spawner.go records what the earlier, non-working version got wrong:
//
//   - The map must be a POSITIONAL URL with "?listen" appended. "?listen" is
//     what starts the net driver. Passing the map as "-Map=<name>" is ignored by
//     the engine entirely.
//   - "-dedicatedserver" is NOT a switch this build has; the string does not
//     occur in the executable. UE's switch is "-server", and a true dedicated
//     mode would need a Server target binary, which was never shipped for this
//     game. A listen server out of the normal client build is what works.
//   - "-nullrhi" is required. Without it the engine wants a GPU and dies during
//     early init -- which is also precisely what makes this headless.
//   - "-log=<unix path>" is meaningless to a Windows binary under Wine, which is
//     why the Revival project saw no instance log.
//
// # On the engine's log file, and why this tool does not use it
//
// Every process using this install writes to the SAME
// %LOCALAPPDATA%\DreadGame\Saved\Logs\DreadGame.log, including the operator's
// own game client. Running a battle server while the client is open produces one
// interleaved file that cannot be read to diagnose anything -- observed
// directly, with the client at frame 506 and the battle server at frame 323
// writing alternating lines into the same file, each rotating the other's log
// away on startup. dn-launcher passes a bare "-LOG", which selects exactly that
// shared default.
//
// "-ABSLOG=<path>" looks like the fix and is NOT one on this build. Tested
// against the shipping executable: with -ABSLOG the engine stops writing
// DreadGame.log -- so the switch is definitely parsed -- but never creates the
// target file either, leaving no engine log at all. That reproduced with a path
// containing spaces AND with a plain "C:\dnlogs" path, so it is not a quoting
// problem; the raw command line was confirmed to reach the process correctly
// quoted. Passing -ABSLOG would therefore make diagnosis strictly worse than
// passing nothing.
//
// So the engine keeps its default log, and this tool captures the child's
// stdout/stderr into its own per-instance file instead. That stream carries the
// lines that matter (LogGameMode match-state transitions, LogOnline, errors) and
// is fully under this process's control.
