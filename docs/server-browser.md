# Server browser: clusters, directory, `dn-dedicated-browser.exe`

Players pick a **cluster** (one full stack from `scripts/start-services.sh`)
and join it. The launcher configures everything automatically: backend
addresses, per-cluster CA trust (TOFU, one Windows confirmation on first
join), sign-in, play. No certificate to install by hand, no JSON editing, no
hosts file — ever.

## Parts

| Part | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `master-master/` | public cluster directory (you run it) | port **8091**, `run/master-master.db` |
| `dn-dedicated` registration loop | each cluster lists itself, no key needed | `dn-dedicated/internal/directory/` |
| `dn-server-browser/` | Windows browser exe | `dn-dedicated-browser.exe` |

## Directory (`master-master`)

One public instance that every cluster knows (`MASTER_MASTER_URL`). SQLite,
same conventions as the other services (`getenv` config, logrus JSON,
`/health`, `/metrics`). **It is deliberately NOT part of the main
`setup.sh`/`start-services.sh`**: only you run it, once, with its own
scripts in `master-master/`:

```bash
bash master-master/setup.sh   # tidy + build run/master-master + run/master-master.env (dashboard password)
bash master-master/start.sh   # :8091 cluster traffic, :8092 admin panel, run/master-master.db
bash master-master/stop.sh
# Admin panel: http://<host>:8092/admin (all interfaces; prefer an SSH tunnel)
```

Routes: `POST /clusters/register` (upsert by name, **open — no key to
request**, but `contact_email` is required), `POST /clusters/{id}/heartbeat`,
`DELETE /clusters/{id}`, `GET /clusters` (public, online only), plus the
operator dashboard under `/admin` (HTTP Basic, `MASTER_ADMIN_PASSWORD`):
full list incl. stale and blocked, MOTD editing, **secret generate/revoke/
send-to-cluster (https only)**, block/unblock (optional reason + auto-expiry
in minutes; elapsed blocks lift on the next heartbeat), delete — plus user
mirror
(search, balances, ban state) and the sync audit log (every communication
logged, both directions). `POST /admin/api/motd-all` writes one MOTD to all
clusters. The dashboard signs in per page load: the password
lives only in the page's JS memory (no cookie, no storage), so every fresh
open and every refresh asks again — the browser never gets a chance to cache
it. The JSON API behind the page stays Basic-authed per request.

Open registration means anyone can list a cluster — removal, not prevention,
is the moderation model: blocking a name refuses its re-registration (403),
so a kicked cluster stays kicked. A stale cluster (no heartbeat for 120 s)
vanishes on its own. `CLUSTER_KEY` does not exist: there is deliberately no
shared secret, so nobody ever needs to ask you for one.

Details per route:

- `POST /clusters/register` — upsert by name: `{name, web_url, battle_ip,
  version, motd, ca_cert, players, servers}` → `{id}`. The `ca_cert` must be
  a PEM certificate; the server computes its SHA-256 fingerprint, which is
  the TOFU anchor every browser shows before first join. Blocked names get
  403.
- `POST /clusters/{id}/heartbeat` — `{players, servers}` (refused for
  blocked ids).
- `DELETE /clusters/{id}` — graceful goodbye.
- `GET /clusters` — online clusters only (stale after 120 s without heartbeat).

## Cluster side (`dn-dedicated serve`)

Every 30 s the control plane re-registers (upsert = heartbeat). Needs, via
flags or env (all optional; unset means unlisted):

| Flag | Env | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--master-master-url` | `MASTER_MASTER_URL` | — | directory URL; empty disables |
| `--cluster-name` | `CLUSTER_NAME` | — | browser display name |
| `--cluster-web-url` | `CLUSTER_WEB_URL` | — | public https URL players authenticate against |
| `--cluster-email` | `CLUSTER_EMAIL` | — | **required to list**: contact address; the operator mails the sync secret there by hand |
| `--cluster-agent-url` | `CLUSTER_AGENT_URL` | — | public https URL of this host's sync agent (`:8093`); empty means no automatic secret delivery |
| `--cluster-ca-file` | `CLUSTER_CA_FILE` | `certs/ca.crt` | CA cert uploaded for TOFU — must be the CA, not server.crt (a server cert is refused with a clear error). Re-read every beat, so rotation needs no restart. Missing file: registers without a CA (public-cert clusters). |
| `--cluster-version` | `CLUSTER_VERSION` | `1.0` | shown in the browser |
| `--cluster-motd` | `CLUSTER_MOTD` | — | shown in the browser (also editable from the dashboard) |
| `--no-master-server-file` | `DN_NO_MASTER_SERVER_FILE` | `run/dn-no-master-server.txt` | presence opts out |

`--server-ip` is reused as the battle address (it already is what clients
are handed). Player/server counts come from the live instances (mocks
excluded). On shutdown the cluster deregisters best-effort.

**Opt out:** create `run/dn-no-master-server.txt` (any content). Checked
every beat and every sync interval: a listed cluster deregisters at once, an
unlisted one stays silent; deleting the file re-lists. No restart either way.
Unlisted clusters are joinable only by manual IP (browser button). Opt-out is
total: no listing AND no account replication — the sync agent sends nothing
and applies nothing while the file exists (so no roaming in or out, and no
presence either: double-play against an opted-out cluster is undetectable by
design — the operator chose invisibility).

## Browser (`dn-dedicated-browser.exe`)

Built from `dn-server-browser/` for Windows (`GOOS=windows go build`).
Flow per cluster, manual or listed:

1. List (or hand-entered IP) → pick a cluster.
2. First join: download its `ca_cert`, show the SHA-256 fingerprint next to
   the directory's value; on confirm, install once into the *current user's*
   Trusted Root store (Windows' own confirmation, no admin, no certmgr).
   Clusters with publicly trusted certificates skip this entirely.
3. The CA is remembered per cluster — later joins need no dialog.
4. Sign in / register on the cluster (accounts live per cluster), Play:
   the game starts with `-GatewayAddress`/`-YFirmamentAddress` pointed at
   the cluster, exactly like `dn-launcher` does today. No hosts file: the
   game resolves no backend by name.

## Browser (`dn-dedicated-browser.exe`)

Built from `dn-server-browser/` for Windows (`GOOS=windows go build`, by
`scripts/setup.sh` into `run/dn-dedicated-browser.exe`). Self-contained
alongside `dn-launcher` (adapted copies, zero changes to the launcher, so no
regression risk where no Windows toolchain is available to verify). Window
resources come from `dn-server-browser/winres/` (`winres.json` reuses the
launcher icon); generate before building:

```bash
cd dn-server-browser && go run github.com/tc-hib/go-winres@v0.3.3 make --in winres/winres.json --arch amd64
```

Build flags (like the launcher): `-H windowsgui` (no console flash),
`-X main.defaultDirectory=https://directory.example.org:8091` (baked-in
directory, overridable in the UI and saved per user).

Flow per cluster, listed or manual:

1. List (or hand-entered IP) → pick a cluster.
2. First join: download its `ca_cert`, show the SHA-256 fingerprint next to
   the directory's value (they must match — a mismatch stops); on confirm,
   install once into the *current user's* Trusted Root store and remember
   the approval in `trusted-cas.json` (re-approval only if the cert
   changes). Clusters with publicly trusted certificates skip this: the
   browser probes with system roots first.
3. The remembered approval is per cluster id (listed) or URL (manual).
   Manual servers additionally need the `ca.crt` text pasted once (stored in
   `browser.json`); without a CA there is nothing the game could trust.
4. Sign in / register on the cluster (credentials stored per cluster,
   DPAPI-encrypted, like `dn-launcher`). Accounts live per cluster.
5. Play: the game starts with `-GatewayAddress`/`-YFirmamentAddress` pointed
   at the cluster — the normal flow, no hosts file (the game resolves no
   backend by name).

`--console` serves the same page in the default browser (loopback API with a
per-run key, like the launcher). `--sign-out` forgets all saved sign-ins.
Game folder, log toggles and Steam lookup share `dn-launcher`'s settings
file, so choosing the folder once counts for both programs.

## Ports & firewall

Per cluster, unchanged: TCP `web_port` (→ 443), TCP 65443, TCP 48843, UDP
battle range. Plus the one public directory: TCP **8091** inbound for clusters and
browsers, and TCP **8092** for the admin panel (both on all interfaces;
firewall the panel or reach it via SSH — Basic over plain HTTP belongs on
loopback).

## Testing it

```bash
# 1. directory + two clusters (different CLUSTER_NAME / ports / DBs)
# 2. fresh Windows VM: no cert, no hosts entry, no JSON
# 3. browser → cluster appears → join → fingerprint confirm → play
# 4. touch run/dn-no-master-server.txt → cluster vanishes within ~2 min,
#    manual IP join still works
```

## Account roaming (stage 3): one account everywhere

Joining a new cluster used to start from zero (own `auth.db` per cluster).
With roaming, accounts — identity, balances, rank, ships, loadouts,
purchases, contracts, career claims, friends/ignores, bans — follow the
player. Design notes:

- **Hub, not mesh.** The directory (`master-master`) holds the mirror
  (`sync_users`, `sync_bans`, `sync_snapshots`, `sync_log`); clusters never
  talk to each other. No shared key exists anywhere.
- **Per-cluster secret, human in the loop.** First registration must carry
  `contact_email` (`CLUSTER_EMAIL`). In the admin dashboard you
  **generate** a secret (shown once — mail it yourself), **revoke** it
  (sync auth dies immediately), or **send** it straight to the cluster
  (always generates fresh, rotating any previous one, and pushes it right
  away; the plaintext is still shown once for the mail backup).
  Only hashes are stored. Auto-send works **only over https** to the
  cluster's agent URL (`CLUSTER_AGENT_URL`, e.g. `https://play.example.org:8093`);
  anything else is refused, never downgraded.
- **The cluster stores it** in `run/sync.env` (0600), either via the agent's
  `POST /sync/key` endpoint (https only, first write wins — a stored secret
  is never overwritten remotely) or by hand + agent restart.
- **Register once, sign in everywhere.** The account is created on one
  cluster; every other cluster takes the same email + password (identity
  roams with the rest). The browser pre-checks the mirror
  (`GET /register-check`) and each cluster answers 409 to a taken callsign
  or address — pulled accounts count, so "already registered" fires across
  clusters too. A name registered twice inside the sync window stays two
  accounts (keyed by id, not email); the agent skips the duplicate on apply
  instead of failing the whole pull.
- **Bans are global.** Ban rows roam with the identity; every synced cluster
  maintains `banned_at` from them and refuses login while it is set. An
  unban propagates as an empty set — no re-banning per cluster, no appeal
  shopping.
- **`sync-agent` binary** (own module, in the normal start/stop scripts):
  every `SYNC_INTERVAL` (60 s) it pushes every local user and pulls remote
  changes; needs `SYNC_MASTER_URL` + `CLUSTER_NAME`, waits without a secret.
  Listens `:8093` https (cluster certs) for key receive + `/health`.
- **Merge rule: last-write-wins per user** on `updated_at` (ties break toward
  the lexicographically greater source, so all hosts agree). Resets
  propagate naturally (emptied state replaces). Clock skew corrupts this —
  run NTP. True simultaneous play is refused up front by the presence guard
  above; the remaining edge (opt-out clusters, dead directory) can still lose
  one side's additive grants — the common case (one cluster at a time) is
  exact.
- **One account, one match.** Every push carries each user's live state
  (active match slot or not); the directory keeps it as presence
  (`sync_presence`, fresh for 120 s — twice the push interval, so one missed
  beat doesn't clear anyone). The browser asks `GET /presence/{user_id}`
  (public, like the cluster list) before enabling Play — and again at launch
  moment — and blocks with the other cluster's name when that account is
  mid-match elsewhere: *"You're already connected to a match on 'X'. Finish
  or leave it there first."* Unknown (no/unreachable directory) lets the
  player through — a dead directory must not strand anyone; the guard is
  best-effort, not a lock. Manual servers exclude by cluster name (no id).
- **Two tables merge smarter than last-write-wins.** Friendships are pair
  rows (two owners): they upsert with accepted-wins — accepted on either
  side, or cross-requested, settles the pair everywhere; one side's sync
  never deletes the other's row. Career claims (`claimed_stages`, monotonic)
  merge per key with MAX, so claiming on two clusters between syncs adds up
  instead of reverting. Unfriending does not propagate (no delete tombstone).
- **Manual sync from the directory dashboard.** **Sync all now** triggers a
  normal push/pull cycle on every cluster with an agent URL
  (`POST {agent_url}/sync/now`, throttled to one run per 10 s per agent, no
  secret needed — a run is idempotent). **Roll out** copies one designated
  main cluster everywhere: the main cluster pushes first, then every other
  cluster applies everything forced (even older snapshots) and pushes —
  afterwards every account the main cluster has reads identically on all of
  them. Accounts that exist only elsewhere are kept, never deleted. If the
  main cluster fails, nobody else is touched. The main cluster is picked in
  the dashboard and stored in the directory DB. Every manual run lands in
  the sync audit log like interval traffic. **Preview rollout** shows the
  counts first (accounts from main, snapshots that would flip, kept-only-
  elsewhere accounts) without touching anything. The **sync status** panel
  shows secret age (with one-click rotation), agent URL,
  last-push/last-pull/mirrored-accounts per cluster with
  an agent reachability test; the **presence board** shows live mid-match
  accounts across clusters; the **heartbeat history** shows online/offline
  transitions per cluster (30 days); the **account sources** chart shows
  which cluster contributed how many mirrored accounts. Operator **notes**
  per cluster, **broadcast MOTD** to all, **temporary blocks** (reason +
  auto-expiry), and a **directory backup** download round out the panel.
- **Not synced, on purpose:** sessions (login tokens stay local),
  queue/matches/slots (live matchmaking), battle results + match history
  (per-cluster audit), chat.
- **Visibility:** admin dashboard shows mirrored users (search, balances,
  ban state) and the full sync audit log (every push/pull/denial, both
  directions). Applied mid-session changes show after re-login at the
  latest (connected clients learn balances at `YA_PlayerGet` / match end).
