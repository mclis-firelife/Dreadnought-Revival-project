	// Was 39422 then 56099. Now MINIMAL: only the 10 validated T1+T2 nodes

	// definitions come from the client's own Content. This keeps the frame far
	// under the client's 32KB (0x8000) mmog receive ring buffer.
	// Now 16938: the TechTrees document is the array-of-arrays shape
	// UYTechTreeManager's loader actually walks, carrying only the fields it
	// resolves by name (Id/ClassId/Manufacturer/Tier/Position/Visible/XPCost/
	// FPCost/NumTechTreeItemsRequired/ProxyType/Prereq/Wires). The previous
	// document was larger because it carried invented fields the loader never
	// read.
	// +176 since: every m_displayInfo grew from ";;;;" to the explicit
	// "-1#-1#-1#-1;-1;-1;-1;-1" form, which stops the client logging an "empty
	// entriy" Error for every vanity slot of every call.
	// Now 13768: the four development loadout aliases collapsed into the real
	// precast ids, leaving 14 items instead of 18 (see
	// nativeStarterLoadoutClassName).
	// Now 14461: +211 for ClassId becoming a real item id. It used to be the
	// 1..15 EYShipClass ordinal (1-2 characters), whose top byte is 0 -- and
	// the manager's store gate admits an item only when (ClassId >> 24) & 0xff
	// is 1 (precast) or 3 (hero), so every node was silently dropped and the
	// tech tree screen had no manufacturers at all. The value is now the hull
	// line's root loadout id, 8 characters, across ~100 nodes; the document is
	// zlib'd, so the frame grows by a fraction of the raw difference and stays
	// far under the client's 32KB receive ring buffer.
	// Now 14550: +89 for ClassId becoming each item's OWN id rather than the
	// hull line's root id. ClassId is the key of the array at manager+0x48,
	// which the client looks up by SHIP ID (FUN_1403f5050, called by
	// ComposeModuleUiDataForShip), so sharing a line root left every tier above
	// it unable to resolve its modules.
	// Now 16454: +1904 for the layout data the loader actually reads. Each item
	// gained a "UI" object holding one named child with Position{x,y}, Visible
	// and an (empty) Wires array -- Position/Visible sent flat on the item were
	// never read, because FUN_1403ffde0 reads them from UI's CHILDREN
	// (1404002b5 indexes the UI node's children pointer). Plus one layout-only
	// tier row per tier, whose Id sits in the negative sentinel range
	// [-2000000,-1000001] that routes it to the manager+0x58 (x, y, Tier) table
	// instead of the item store. Document is zlib'd, so this is a fraction of
	// the raw growth and leaves ~16KB of headroom under the 32KB ring.
	// Now 21505: +5051 for the per-ship MODULE entries. Every consumer of a
	// ship's modules reads the modules TArray at record+0x08 of
	// FindShipTechTreeData's array, and the loader files an entry there only
	// when its ProxyType is -1 (140401443); ProxyType 9 goes to the proxyItems
	// array at +0x18, which is what draws the tree. Sending 9 on everything
	// filled the tree and emptied the modules, so every ship read "0/0 modules
	// available". These entries are deliberately MINIMAL -- no UI, Position,
	// Visible, Prereq or Wires -- because only +0x20/+0x2C/+0x3C are read off
	// the stored record; the full form put the frame at 35103 bytes, over the
	// 32768-byte ring. 21505 leaves ~11KB of headroom.
	// Now 25846: the module entries became an UPGRADE PATH instead of a copy of
	// the equipped loadout. A slot's line is one asset name with a _T<n> token
	// and each tier is a separately registered item
	// (WP_AssaultMPri01_weapon01_T1_BP .. _T5_BP), so a slot now emits its
	// equipped item plus every STRICTLY higher tier of the same line -- 947
	// entries across 52 hulls, versus 237 before, which listed the current
	// loadout back at the player with nothing to research. Still minimal per
	// entry and ~7KB under the 32768-byte ring.
	// Now 25383: module entries are the ALTERNATIVES only. The client draws a
	// ship's fitted modules itself from its UYCachedItemIDData slot list (tags
	// 1..10), so anything sent for a slot is IN ADDITION to what is already on
	// the rail -- sending the equipped item too is what showed the default
	// loadout twice, three attempts running. The equipped LINE is excluded
	// whole, because a module's tier is not a separate node. 937 entries,
	// ~7.4KB under the 32768 ring.
	//
	// Now 23943 (-1440): module alternatives are gated to the HULL'S TIER. A
	// line whose lowest variant sits above the hull contributes nothing, where
	// it used to contribute that variant regardless -- which is how the Tier 1
	// Agosta's tech tree came to offer Tier 5 modules, reported from a live
	// client as "the module tech tree shows the wrong modules for each ship".
	// The payload SHRANK because tier-1 and tier-2 hulls lost entries they
	// should never have had; tier 5 GREW from 2 modules to ~23 in the same
	// change, because their fitted abilities sit on the previous build's
	// tier-less asset paths and were invisible to the slot index until
	// techTreeAbilityAssetUntiered.
	//
	// Now 23762 (-181): hull nodes no longer name THEMSELVES in ClassId. The
	// client recurses into the item its ClassId names (FUN_3F4880 ->
	// FUN_3F51A0 -> FUN_3F4880), so a hull pointing at itself was an infinite
	// loop and a guaranteed EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW on any module click. A
	// hull now points at its prerequisite, and a line root or hero at 0. The
	// shrink is those roots and heroes carrying "0" instead of an 8-digit id.
	//
	// KNOWN COST, accepted deliberately: the loader gate drops ClassId <= 0
	// (TEST R15D,R15D / JLE skip), so those 63 nodes are not stored. Verified
	// live on 2026-08-08 that the tree still works -- 12 module panels opened,
	// zero crashes, and none of the symptoms dropped nodes used to cause
	// ("Could not find a manufacturer with id", "TreeWidgetList of length 0")
	// appeared. TestLineRootsAndHeroesAreTheOnlyDroppedNodes pins the 63 so it
	// cannot grow quietly; giving roots a category-1 id that is not a tree row
	// would recover them and is the open refinement.
	//
	// Now 16272 (-7490): per-ship MODULE entries are no longer sent, at the
	// operator's instruction -- we were emitting hundreds per ship while the
	// client displayed a base plus two, so the two sets disagreed by an order
	// of magnitude and every module observation was made through a screen
	// showing the wrong thing. This is a deliberate reduction to a known-good
	// baseline, NOT a fix: why only three appear is still unexplained.
	// DN_TECHTREE_WITH_MODULES=1 restores them; see techTreeNoModules.
	// 16272 -> 16211 (-61): Brutus (T5 AssaultLight, 33489299) removed. The
	// register still carries its id but the client has no cooked blueprint for
	// it, so it has been removed from the game; offering it put a ship in the
	// tree that cannot be loaded. It was inside the 64-byte tolerance, which is
	// exactly why the number is updated rather than left to drift.
	// 16211 -> 11899 (-4312) WITH modules back in: the plain
	// result/techTreeRow/moduleUiData block is no longer sent. The client reads
	// only the TechTrees blob, and that block grew one row per owned ship --
	// ~11KB for an account owning all 99, which put a module-bearing tree at
	// 35,023 bytes, over the 32768 ring. Modules re-enabled by default
	// (techTreeNoModules); a techTreeFrameBudget guard drops them rather than
	// hang login if a tree would still not fit.
	// 11899 -> 11970 (+71): line roots and heroes carry their line's legacy
	// anchor id in ClassId instead of "0". Those 63 nodes were dropped by the
	// loader gate (ClassId <= 0) and were the ships missing from the tree.
	// 11970 -> 12058 (+88): weapon and module entries carry the per-ship id
	// (inflatedItemID) instead of the shared 0xFF one. The entry count is
	// unchanged; the ids simply repeat less across hulls, so zlib does worse.
	// 12058 -> 14051 (+1993): each hull's research list is now read from the
	// client's module preview table (dreadconfig.ShipResearchItems) instead of
	// composed from sibling asset lines: 811 -> 1131 weapon/module entries
	// (Trafalgar 4 -> 9, the tier-1 starters 0 -> 5). Still well inside the
	// ~26KB proven safe; TestTechTreeFitsTheRingWhenEverythingIsOwned covers
	// the owned-everything case.
	// 14051 -> 14296 (+245): Brutus (AssaultLight T5, 33489299) joins the roster
	// -- its asset is named "PrecastLoadout_T5", the cooked dump missed it and the
	// generator had dropped it as removed -- and every hull above tier 1 now carries
	// its prerequisite from the game's own unlock tree (tech_tree_links.go), where
	// 11 line roots had none (2026-09-28). ~26KB is proven safe.
	// 18884 for one evening (2026-09-29) while module entries carried Prereq;
	// that crashed the client and is off by default (DN_TECHTREE_MODULE_PREREQ).
	"YA_GetTechTree": 14296,
	// Was 1035, +185 after fixing int32-blindness (CurrentXP/CurrentRank/
	// RankXP/XPToNextRank/NumUnlockedShips and per-ship shipID/xp/tier now
	// numeric strings, matching the rest of this payload family).
	// Was 1220/4040. Now 857: progression tracks only the 10 validated T1+T2
	// tech-tree ships (see techTreeShips).
	// Was 1097, +56: "owned" -> "m_isOwned" on every ship row (the old name is
	// absent from the client binary), and PurchasesData entries changed from
	// int32 to numeric strings so the client can actually read them.
	// 1153 -> 1180 (+27): an empty root "ProgressionData" array -- the
	// researched-items list the client reads off the document root (parser
	// 0x2A79920 -> player-data +0x3F80, HasResearchedItem). Empty here because
	// the default player has researched nothing.
	"YA_GetPlayerProgression": 1180,
	// 100 -> 436 (+336): "PurchasesData" moved from under "result" to the root,
	// where the parser (0x2A796D0 -> player-data +0x3F90) reads it, and now
	// includes the per-ship ids of the default player's fitted defaults, so the
	// ship's own modules read as owned instead of asking to be researched.
	// 436 -> 492 (+56): the owned hulls themselves (4 starters x 14 bytes).
	// The client accepts a tier-2's prerequisite only from this list or
	// ProgressionData (GetTechTreeItemState 0x543890 -> 0x548990), and the
	// starters were in neither, so no tier-2 could be researched.
	"YA_GetPlayerPurchases": 492,
	// Was 305, then 233 after removing fabricated Eligible/isEligible bool
	// fields (issue #51 — zero footprint in the client binary). Now 953: the
	// body is the FleetTypes/Maintenance shape FUN_142a78790 actually parses,
	// shared with YA_RequestStaticFleetData. The old "fleet_eligibility" array
	// was smaller because none of its field names were ones the client reads.
	"YA_FleetEligibility": 953,
	// Was 368116 (full tuning tables) — that overflowed the 16-bit mmog frame
	// size field and desynced the client stream, blocking hangar entry. Now sends
	// empty override tables (client uses its backup asset tuning); see
	// buildMmogTunePayload.
	//
	// 299 -> 305 (+6): the RT changed from "YA_Tune" to "YA_TuneReturn", which is
	// six characters longer. The client sends YA_Tune and dispatches the reply on
	// YA_TuneReturn, so the old name matched no branch and the response was
	// dropped silently -- YTuneManager::Set() never ran at all. Evidence in
	// buildMmogTunePayload.
	//
	// The real ceiling here is the client's 32768-byte receive ring, NOT the
	// 65535 frame limit an earlier version of this comment cited: a 40,316-byte
	// YA_Tune hung a live client on 2026-08-15. See tune_frame_size_test.go.
	//
	// 305 -> 242 (-63): the tables moved INSIDE a zlib blob named "packed",
	// which is the only field the client reads (dispatcher 0x142a27b17 ->
	// byte-array accessor 0x142a14200). The frame now carries RT + one
	// compressed document instead of eight loose JSON strings. Compression is
	// roughly 10:1 on this data, so the ring is no longer the binding
	// constraint it was.
	// 242 -> 244 (+2): MetaData moved to be the LAST child of Returning. With it
	// first, the client read an EMPTY version out of a document that demonstrably
	// contained "1.0.0" -- the parsed-tree corruption CONTRIBUTING.md records for
	// a container followed by siblings. Two bytes because zlib re-packs the same
	// content in a different order.
	//
	// 244 -> 17868: the tables carry REAL data now. Empty tables stopped being
	// safe the moment the packed blob started parsing -- the client trusted them
	// and every weapon row missed ("Couldn't find OTS data for weapon ... Trying
	// in offline datatable", measured live in a proving-ground match). This is
	// 205,534 bytes of tuning compressed to 17,868 on the wire, carrying
	// Weapons/Projectiles/Officers/GameModifiers/Abilities in full. FeatsTune is
	// the one that does not fit the budget and is still sent empty.
	// 14730 -> 21280: WeaponsTune and OfficersTune are now the cooked OTS tables
	// echoed VERBATIM -- every row, every field, keyed by blueprint asset name.
	// The old builder synthesised RowName as "Weapon_<itemID>", walked an
	// item-id-keyed map that dropped 67 of the table's 226 rows outright (creep
	// weapons and turret abilities have no item id), and copied 11 of 47 fields.
	// A live client asked for 'WP_CreepPrimary01_weapon01_BP' and could not find
	// it, once per weapon per pawn. AbilitiesTune now fits the budget too.
	// FeatsTune is still empty: including it would take the frame to ~32.4KB,
	// 99% of the 32768-byte ring.
	// 21280 -> 49: the packed tune document is no longer sent by default
	// (DN_TUNE_SEND=1 restores it). The client applied it with an empty version
	// and no resolvable tables, replacing its working backup weapon tables with
	// nothing -- no projectile could spawn in the first match that reached the
	// arena (2026-09-24). Now only RT goes out and the client keeps its own.
	"YA_Tune":          49,
	"YA_GetSeasonData": 650,
	// YA_PlayerGet's Officers array schema was fixed (#41) to send the

	// that parser never looked up — legitimately smaller, not a regression.

	// never-purchased players instead of sending it with ExpireTime="0":
	// the client's parser (FUN_142a85120) drives a present-but-zero object

	// crash during hangar entry. Sending no object at all uses the client's
	// own dedicated "no membership" branch instead.
	// Was 10810, then 10816, now 10825. The first step made credits/premium
	// numeric strings; that changed nothing in game, because the FIELD NAMES

	// `strings -n 2` -- the 4-char default hides every short field name here),
	// while tll/tpl/tc/rep/FreeXp/Credits all appear. They were invented, so
	// credits and premium were never delivered at all. Renamed to the pair this
	// codebase already knew from YA_RewardCurrencies: root-level "Credits" and
	// "Points". +9 is the longer names.
	// +56 on 2026-08-04: each of the four fleet loadout entries gained m_shipId

	// carry a ship id, loaded the correct bay for their size. See the comment
	// at the field in buildMmogPlayerFleetsPayload.
	// 10881 -> 9761 (-1120): owned-inventory entries no longer carry
	// NewPromotionID "0" and Credits "0". The client's field lookup returns a
	// static EMPTY node for a missing field (0x140237c8d -> 0x140237cb0), which
	// reads as 0 -- so absent is identical to "0", at 46 bytes per entry instead

	// 62,150-byte YA_PlayerGet and hung the client; see playerDataFrameBudget.
	// 9761 -> 7297 (-2464): ShipLoadouts entries carry only the 17 fields the
	// client's entry parser reads (field block 0x142a700f0-0x142a706c0), not the
	// ~45 they used to, with empty slots omitted -- ~1063 -> ~420 bytes each.
