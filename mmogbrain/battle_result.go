// tables are lost -- GitHub issue #71): credits 1500 for a
// win / 750 otherwise, +100 per kill; XP 1000 / 500, +50 per kill, granted as
// free XP, as rank XP and split over the ships flown. Each is overridable.
//
// Formula (operator, 2026-09-28):
//
//	Intermediate  = Base Reward (win/loss) + Performance Reward (per kill)
//	Total XP      = Intermediate_xp      x (1 + 1.25 + 0.25 + Fleet + EliteTeam%)
//	Total Credits = Intermediate_credits x (1 + 0.75 + 0.25 + Fleet + EliteTeam%)
//
// Same formula in every game mode. Fleet is the fleet battle bonus of the
// match's fleet tier: Recruit 100%, Veteran 125%, Legendary 150% (operator,
// 2026-09-28) -- the formula's "1.00" term, which is the Recruit value. The
// tier comes from the match record (matches.fleet_type, keyed by the battle
// server's match id); a result whose match is unknown pays Recruit.
//
// Configurable: DN_REWARD_XP_BONUSES / DN_REWARD_CREDIT_BONUSES (the fixed
// terms, comma-separated fractions), DN_REWARD_FLEET_BONUSES (Recruit,
// Veteran, Legendary) and DN_REWARD_ELITE_TEAM_PCT (a percentage, 0 by
// default: nothing grants it yet). The fixed terms apply to every result.
