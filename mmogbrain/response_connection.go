// seasonDataResponseDisabled once withheld YA_GetSeasonData entirely, as a
// last-ditch attempt to stop the hangar-entry EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW in
// UYPlayerMPQuestCycle::OnBackendDataAvailable. It is off because that
// experiment was run and FAILED: the client crashed identically with the
// response withheld.
//
// A full recursive stack (5MB stack-only minidump, 2026-07-27) then showed
// why no server payload can prevent that crash. The cycle is entirely
// client-side and unconditional:
//
//	OnBackendDataAvailable (FUN_1403fe800) subscribes itself to the quest
//	collection's delegate at +0x48, then calls UYMPQuestsCollection's loader
//	(FUN_140404440). When every YMPQ_* quest asset is already resolved there
//	is nothing to async-load, so the loader invokes the "loaded" callback
//	(FUN_140402db0) SYNCHRONOUSLY — and that callback ends by broadcasting
//	the very +0x48 delegate just subscribed to, re-entering
//	OnBackendDataAvailable with identical state. Nothing advances, so it
//	recurses until the stack is exhausted (~2824 frames observed).
//
// Confirmed against a full crash dump: the collection holds 24 loaded quest
// entries, 0 pending loads, and both load counters at 0 — so the "is a load
// still outstanding?" guard both functions share is false on every pass.
//
// Nothing in that path reads server data: the quest list comes from the
// client's own MPQuestCollection.uasset, and the season/event block we do
// feed (interface +0x44a0..+0x44c8) is passed to the loader as an argument
// it never reads. This is why every earlier server-side attempt — empty
// Seasons/Events, real season metadata, real vs fabricated daily-contract
// ids, delaying the response, and withholding it — changed nothing. Fixing
// it requires a client-side change, not a wire change.
//
// CORRECTED 2026-09-25: two claims above are wrong. The loader DOES read that
// argument (RDX is passed straight to the copy at 0x14040446A; the decompile
// drops it), and it is not the season block but the daily-contracts catalog
// (+0x44A0 is filled from YA_GetDailyContractsData's ContractTable). With rows
// that resolve to quest assets the collection map is non-empty and the cycle
// takes its normal branch. It is a wire change after all; see

			//
			//   FUN_142a33640 ("Sending daily contracts data request") issues
			//   this request on slot interface+0x3690. The response handler
			//   inside FUN_142a21cf0 matches that slot, then calls
			//   FUN_142a6b7f0(interface+0x44a0, payload) — which parses
			//   ContractConfigTable / ContractTable / ContractNextResetTime and
			//   then executes `*(byte *)(block + 0x28) = 1`, i.e.
			//   interface+0x44c8 = 1, UNCONDITIONALLY, whatever the contents —
			//   and finally broadcasts interface+0x1070.
			//
			//   interface+0x44c8 is the gate in
			//   UYPlayerMPQuestCycle::OnBackendDataAvailable (FUN_1403fe800):
			//   while it is 0 the cycle binds to interface+0x1070 and waits
			//   harmlessly; once it is 1 the cycle walks
			//   UYMPQuestsCollection instead, and because every YMPQ_* asset is
			//   already resolved the loader invokes the "loaded" callback
			//   synchronously, which re-broadcasts the delegate the cycle just
			//   subscribed to — unbounded recursion (~2824 frames observed) and
			//   EXCEPTION_STACK_OVERFLOW right after "Entering Hangar".
			//
			// CORRECTED 2026-09-25: the conclusion drawn from this trace was
			// wrong. The gate is set unconditionally, but whether the cycle
			// recurses depends on the ContractTable ROWS. The loader
			// (FUN_140404440) copies them in from its second argument (RDX,
			// passed straight through at 0x14040446A; the decompile drops it,
			// hence "never reads it"), and the callback adds every row whose Id
			// matches a quest's m_id to the collection map at +0x98. A NON-empty
			// map sends OnBackendDataAvailable down its normal branch
			// (FUN_1403ff210) on re-entry. The recursion needs an empty map --
			// which is what we always produced, because our reply never had a
			// ContractTable (Quests/Contracts belong to YA_ContractReplace, and
			// that is where the "real vs fabricated YMPQ_ ids" went). The reply
