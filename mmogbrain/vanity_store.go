// Cosmetics in the store (2026-09-26).
//
// Every ship and captain cosmetic the developers marked ready for players is
// listed, built from the client's own data assets (dreadconfig.VanityItems;
// data/vanity/VanityItems_cooked.jsonl) -- NOT from the retail catalog's
// "Captain Vanity"/"Coatings"/... offers, whose ids are storefront offer ids
// with no mapping to items (see asset_tables_validation.go).
//
// Pricing is the operator's decision: every sold cosmetic costs vanityPrice in
// vanityCurrency (premium), the "free" defaults (dreadconfig.VanityItemIsFree)
// included. The assets carry no price.
//
// Why a cosmetic is only OWNED once bought: ownership reaches
// the client only through the Items list in player data, and that list is
// capped by the client's 32768-byte receive ring (playerDataFrameBudget; an
// account owning every ship and module already overflows it). The parser
// (FUN_2A6CED0) resets the list before filling it, so it cannot be streamed in
// pieces, and nothing the client sends says which menu it is in. Owning all
// 1027 listed cosmetics up front would push modules out of that list; owning
// what a player actually chose grows it by one entry per choice.
